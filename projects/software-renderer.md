### Software Renderer

[Source](https://github.com/marsp0/software-renderer)

Software renderer written from scratch (only exception is SDL that is being used for window management). The goal of the project is for me to better understand the 
graphics pipeline and implement the most common features found in rendering engines. See the repo for list of resources used.
